NQ, MANCHESTER.</h2>\n  </div>\n\n  <hr class=\"section-spacer\">\n\n  <div class=\"event__body\">\n    <p>Well, well, well. It's that time again, already! And this time, it's a big one! By now you probably know the drill, but for the newbies out there, the 4th Digital Heroes is here!</p>\n\n    <p>As per tradition on my birthday; a fancy dress night out with all my closest friends &amp; wonderful Web/digital folk of Manchester. (<em>Don't worry, fancy dress is optional!</em>), but a lot of us definitely go all out, so feel free to get involved! - <em><a href=\"#twitter-stream\">see previous years below for ideas.</a></em> </p>\n\n    <p>This year we'll also be celebrating <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://twitter.com/jag4091\">Jag</a>'s send off to fatherhood - also known as the death of Jag. (<em>RIP, Jag.</em>)</p>\n\n    <p>The plan is as follows:</p>\n\n    <h2>18:00, SAT 6TH @ HOLD FAST BAR, NQ</h2>\n    <p>We've got the awesome cinema room at <strong>Hold Fast Bar</strong>, NQ (<em><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.google.co.uk/maps/place/Hatters+Hostel+Ltd,+50+Newton+St,+Manchester+M1+2EA,+UK/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x487bb1bebd5bc86d:0x7fa80a60c013c919?sa=X&amp;ei=KYFbVd7QB8OUsgHjp4GIBg&amp;ved=0CCEQ8gEwAA\">50 Newton Street, Manchester M1 2EA</a></em>) booked all evening! It's got its own A/V system, and a huge projector. So the plan is to watch the Champions League Final, play Mario Kart / Smash Bros / Splatoon for the Wii U, and listen to beltin' tunes; then potentially head over the road to the Crown &amp; Anchor for a game of pool, then off to Satan's Hollow.</p>\n\n    <h2>REALTIME DIARY OF THE EVENT</h2>\n\n    <p>Leave a tweet with the hashtag <strong>#digitalheroes2015</strong> and your message (including images) will be pulled in below in realtime. Let's get a diary of the build up, and of the night itself! :-)</p>\n  </div>\n\n  <div class=\"event__footer\">\n    <hr>\n    <h2 class=\"island-title\">LIVE TWITTER FEED â€“ #digitalheroes2015</h2>\n    <hr>\n  </div>\n</div>\n"
