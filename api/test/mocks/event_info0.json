The one in the summer was so good, we're doing it again, for Halloween!</p>\n\n    <p>As per Digital Heroes tradition; a fancy dress night out with all my closest friends &amp; wonderful Web/digital folk of Manchester. (<em>Fancy dress is a <u>must</u> this time! :P</em>) - <em><a href=\"#twitter-stream\">see previous years below for ideas.</a></em> </p>\n\n    <p>The plan is as follows:</p>\n    <h2>18:00, SAT 31ST @ TBD, NQ</h2>\n    <p>Plan is hazy at the moment. Liverpool play Chelsea in the afternoon, so the festivities could potentially start as early as 12:45pm! All i know at the moment is we'll be off to Satan's Hollow in the evening.</p>\n\n    <h2>REALTIME DIARY OF THE EVENT</h2>\n\n    <p>Leave a tweet with the hashtag <strong>#digitalheroes2015</strong> or <strong>#halloweenheroes2015</strong> and your message (including images) will be pulled in below in realtime.
