    //- p Every year, since i can remember, fancy dress and drink fueled antics have been a part of my birthday celebrations. This year i turn 25, and I'd love to get all my friends and digital people out for a bit of a celebration.

    //- p I've been thinking of ways to get the word out, when i thought, 'hey, why not make a website and create a little bit of hype!'. <em>Any excuse to exercise some HTML5 animation techniques Michael Bay would be proud of if he was a web developer, ha.</em>

    // - p Following on from last year's super hero antics, <strong>Digital Heroes</strong> is back!

    //- h2 A 28TH BIRTHDAY CELEBRATION...

    p Well, well, well. It's that time again, already! And this time, it's a big one! By now you probably know the drill, but for the newbies out there, the 4th Digital Heroes is here!
    
    p As per tradition on my birthday; a fancy dress night out with all my closest friends &amp; wonderful Web/digital folk of Manchester. (<em>Don't worry, fancy dress is optional!</em>), but a lot of us definitely go all out, so feel free to get involved! - <em><a href="#twitter-stream">see previous years below for ideas.</a></em> 
    
    p This year we'll also be celebrating <a target="_blank" href="http://twitter.com/jag4091">Jag</a>'s send off to fatherhood - also known as the death of Jag. (<em>RIP, Jag.</em>)
    
    p The plan is as follows:
    
    h2 18:00, SAT 6TH @ HOLD FAST BAR, NQ
    p We've got the awesome cinema room at <strong>Hold Fast Bar</strong>, NQ (<em><a target="_blank" href="https://www.google.co.uk/maps/place/Hatters+Hostel+Ltd,+50+Newton+St,+Manchester+M1+2EA,+UK/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x487bb1bebd5bc86d:0x7fa80a60c013c919?sa=X&ei=KYFbVd7QB8OUsgHjp4GIBg&ved=0CCEQ8gEwAA">50 Newton Street, Manchester M1 2EA</a></em>) booked all evening! It's got its own A/V system, and a huge projector. So the plan is to watch the Champions League Final, play Mario Kart / Smash Bros / Splatoon for the Wii U, and listen to beltin' tunes; then potentially head over the road to the Crown &amp; Anchor for a game of pool, then off to Satan's Hollow.
    
    //- p We're thinking <strong>8.30pm (ish)</strong> at the <strong>Crown &amp; Anchor</strong> on Hilton Street (41 Hilton St, Manchester, M1 2EE) to play some pool, then off to bigger places. It'd be great if you could come along! We'll also be hitting up <strong>Common Bar</strong> after work (6ish) for food.

    h2 REALTIME DIARY OF THE EVENT
    p Leave a tweet with the hashtag <strong>#digitalheroes2015</strong> and your message (including images) will be pulled in below in realtime. Let's get a diary of the build up, and of the night itself! :-)
    p Hopefully see you there! <br> Scotty (<a target="_blank" href="http://twitter.com/KingScooty">@KingScooty</a>)
